    "The log-log chart shows the relation between log(rank) (Y-axis) and log(frequency) (X-axis). It is close to linear relation especially in the middle where most words exits. As is mentioned in Zipf's Law: \n",
    "    word rank * word frequency = constant * total number of words in collections\n",
    "which can be re-written as:\n",
    "    r*f = A*N -> r = M*(f^(-1))\n",
