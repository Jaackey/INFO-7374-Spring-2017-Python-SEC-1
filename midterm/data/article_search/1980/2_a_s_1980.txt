The action begins next Wednesday at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. at Christie's, Park Avenue at 59th Street, with the sale of Japanese swords, sword furniture such as hand guards, utility knives, hairpins and sword and scabard mounts, and works of art. What the auction house described as ''the most important Shinto sword to be offered for public sale in the West in the last 40 years'' is the top lot in a sale of 329 offerings. The masterpiece blade, called a katana, is signed by its maker Kotetsu, a 17thcentury master craftsman who came from Nagasone, later moved to Okisato and is regarded as the greatest artist of the Shinto period, according to Robert E. Haynes, an expert on sword fittings and blades who is a consultant to Christie's. The blade was forged around 1644, when the artisan was believed to be at the peak of his powers. The presale estimate is up to $90,000. Other major offerings include a sword signed by Masayoshi and dated 1776 that is believed to have belonged to the provincial governor of Satsuma (up to $25,000) and a finely crafted tanto (short dagger) signed by Kiyondo, made around 1860, that may sell for as much as $10,000. Of the tsuba, or sword guards, up for bids in this dispersal of examples dating from the 13th to the 18th century, the prize lot is from the Kamakura period in the armorer style of Katchushi, circa 1300, and is estimated to sell for up to $4,000.", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"original": "By Rita Reif", "person": [{"organization": "", "lastname": "Reif", "firstname": "Rita", "rank": 1, "role": "reported"}]}, "snippet": "ORIENTAL art works and robes are among the most important offerings next week in five specialty sales at New York's two main auction houses.
