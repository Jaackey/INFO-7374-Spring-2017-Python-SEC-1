Washington has, and will continue to have, accredited representatives in countries that it condemns for aggression. Rather, what matters is that it can conduct a balanced, non-paranoid foreign policy.

It carried a petition signed by more than 500 Americans, many of them distinguished, calling for the recognition of Vietnam. Although almost all had personally condemned Hanoi's overthrow of Pol Pot, their plea was dismissed as pro-Hanoi. Lincoln P.
