It marks the consolidation of the post-Mao regime, the ascendancy of practical leaders over ideologues. And it reinforces the two-track system that distinguishes Communist states: the party as policy-maker, the government as manager. Peking appears now to be moving briskly to refit its ship of state. The ideological sails have been trimmed; Mao, the Great Helmsman, will no longer be allowed near the wheel, even in spirit. The party chairman since Mao's death, Hua Guofeng, is yielding his other job, as Prime Minister, to Mr. Zhao. And Mr. Zhao, it should be understood, is a protege of China's actual leader in recent years, Deng Xiaoping, who has served with the quaint title of First Deputy Prime Minister.
