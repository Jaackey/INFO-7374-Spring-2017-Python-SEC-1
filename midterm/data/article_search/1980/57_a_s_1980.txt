Asked point blank last week whether he favors ''official relations'' with Taiwan, yes or no, the Republican nominee responded, ''Ah, I guess it's a yes.'' In short, Mr. Reagan cannot readily tell a lie, or even a diplomatic fib. But the result of such candor is to persuade Peking that the Governor is either unreliable or inscrutable. Oddly enough, not even Taiwan is pressing for any ''official relations'' that would jeopardize Washington's evolving ties with Peking. Almost as diarming was George Bush's defense while in China of another of Mr. Reagan's usages. The Governor recurrently refers to ''the free Republic of China,'' which the Peking regime regards as a slur on its own claims to legitimacy. What does Mr. Reagan really mean? According to Mr. Bush, such language stems from habits of speech, rather than policy views. Perhaps Reagan staff members should be required to annotate all of their candidate's future utterances to distinguish between new and significant and merely habitual.", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": null, "snippet": "There is something disarming in the spectacle of Ronald Reagan thrashing around in his own China shop.

Mr. Amburg, who is out of the rat-a-tat-tat school of news readings, went on a typical tourist's tour of China, with rigid itinerary and fairly close supervision. The difference is that he and his wife, an associate producer, were allowed to bring a film crew. Going from the major cities to the sprawling countryside, the documentary looks at China through its different age groups: babies (proof positive of the country's worrying population explosion), youth and old folks. Mr. Amburg bombards the viewer with statistics, most of them awesome, that reinforce the fact that China is a nation of nearly a billion people, 400 million of them born in the last 30 years.", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"original": "By JOHN J.
