    "- The result is interesting, as we can see from CSV file. In the year 1980, NYT focus very much on politics and government relating to China, which is only the 10th focus subject in 2010.\n",
    "- Just as the example above, we can jump to several further conclusions:\n",
    "- For China, what NYT cares the most in 1980 is China's politics and government while in 2010 is international trade and world market. The change of focus reflects how China developed in these 30 years.\n",
    "- Economic conditions and trends are always a main focus during these years.\n",
    "- In 2010, computers and the Internet, a keyword in top 3 focus showed up, which cannot be found in even top 50 of year 1980. Thus computers and the Internet is definitely a hot concern of China in recent years."
